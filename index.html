            <h2>Her Life</h2>
            <p>Abby loves hunting, eating, and sleeping. She knows how to make herself understood when she wants something, whether it's food, playtime, or going outside.</p>

            <h2>Her Habits</h2>
            <p>Abby enjoys relaxing in the sun and prefers playing with us rather than with toys. She loves warm and cozy spots, like clothes left on the floor. She's not always a fan of cuddles, but she loves kisses. She only accepts cuddles when we're wearing bathrobes or blankets. And she has a strong preference: she only drinks water from the tap!</p>
